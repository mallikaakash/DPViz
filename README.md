Presenting DpViz, the best way to learn dynamic programming.

Inspiration:
I had initially built a basic prototype of this in June,2023, while I learning Dynamic Programming as a preparation for my internship drive. I personally found it tedious to draw and visualize the exact stepwise process of dynamic programming problems. So, I decided to build a web app that would help me visualize the derivation of the solution better.

Current Work:
I am rebuilding this project from scratch, with a better UI and more problems, using NextJS and other visually appealing elements.

The current problems included here are the Knasack, COin change, fibonacci, LIS, LCS, minimum steps to transform string and matrix chain multiplication.


Contribute:
It would be a great pleasure if you choose to contribute to this project. You can add more problems, improve the UI and make it more interactive. Some improvements would be to add the recursive tree visualizations or a more game-like interactive mode.
